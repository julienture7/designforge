## Post Body:

Hey everyone,

So I've been working on this AI website generator called DesignForge for the past few months, and I finally got it to a place where I'm comfortable sharing it. I wanted to post here because I think this community will actually understand what I'm trying to do.

**The problem I was trying to solve:**

You know how most AI website builders just... make the same generic sites? Like, you ask for a landing page and you get another Bootstrap-looking thing with rounded corners, blue buttons, and lorem ipsum everywhere. I got so frustrated with that.

I wanted to build something that actually generates *interesting* designs. Like, designs that could win awards. So I trained the AI on a very specific aesthetic - think Brutalism meets Swiss Design meets high-fashion editorial. The kind of stuff you see on Awwwards.

**What it actually does:**

You type something like "restaurant landing page" and it generates a complete, single-file HTML page. But here's the thing - it's not generic. It uses bold typography, interesting color choices (no Bootstrap blue!), and actually writes decent copy instead of lorem ipsum.

The AI has this "anti-boredom directive" built in where it explicitly avoids all the generic patterns we're used to seeing. No rounded corners everywhere, no default shadows, no placeholder text.

**The cool part (I think):**

After you generate something, you can actually chat with it to refine it. Like "make the hero section bigger" or "add a pricing table" or "change it to dark mode." It remembers the context and actually makes intelligent changes. That part took forever to get right.

**What surprised me:**

I didn't expect it to be so context-aware. If you ask for a restaurant site, it automatically includes things like a menu section and reservation interface. For SaaS, it adds pricing tables and feature grids. It's not just slapping content together - it's actually thinking about what that type of site needs.

**The technical stuff:**

- Uses multiple AI models (Devstral for fast generation, DeepSeek for medium quality, Gemini 3 Pro for the premium tier)
- Outputs complete, valid HTML with Tailwind CSS
- Includes scroll animations and responsive design
- Integrates with Unsplash for images automatically
- Everything is production-ready - you can literally copy and deploy

**Pricing:**

I'm doing a free tier with 20 credits (one-time, not daily) so people can actually try it without committing. Then there's a Pro tier at €19.99/month with 300 credits and access to the premium AI model.

**What I'd love from you:**

Honestly, I'd really appreciate feedback. What features are missing? What would make this actually useful for your workflow? I'm still iterating based on what people actually need.

Also, if you try it and it generates something terrible, please tell me. I want to know what's not working.

**Questions/comments/roasts welcome.** This is my first real product launch and I'm genuinely curious what the community thinks.

Thanks for reading!

## Alternative Shorter Version:

Hey r/webdev,

I built an AI website generator that doesn't make boring sites. After months of tweaking prompts and fighting with AI models, I finally got it to output designs that are actually interesting.

**The thing:** You describe what you want, it generates a complete HTML page. But instead of generic Bootstrap-looking stuff, it creates designs inspired by Brutalism, Swiss Design, and high-fashion editorial. The kind of sites that could win Awwwards.

**What makes it different:**
- Actually writes copy (no lorem ipsum)
- Uses bold, interesting colors (no Bootstrap blue)
- Context-aware (restaurants get menus, SaaS gets pricing tables)
- You can refine it through chat after generation
- Production-ready HTML, ready to deploy

**The catch:** It's not perfect. Sometimes it generates weird stuff. But when it works, it's pretty cool.

Free tier with 20 credits to try it: [your-url]

Would love your thoughts - what features would actually make this useful? What's missing?

## Even More Casual Version:

So I've been building this AI website thing for a while and I'm finally ready to show it to people.

The idea was simple: what if AI could generate websites that don't look like every other AI-generated website? You know, the ones with rounded corners and blue buttons and lorem ipsum everywhere.

I trained it on a really specific aesthetic - think brutalist design meets Swiss typography meets fashion magazines. The result is... actually pretty interesting? Sometimes it generates weird stuff, but when it works, it creates sites that look genuinely unique.

You can generate a site, then chat with it to refine it. "Make it darker" or "add a pricing section" - that kind of thing. It actually works pretty well.

I'm doing a free tier (20 credits) so people can try it without paying. If you're curious, check it out: [your-url]

Would love feedback. What would make this actually useful? What am I missing?

## Key Elements That Make It "Human":

✅ Admits it's not perfect ("sometimes it generates weird stuff")
✅ Shares the journey ("I spent 6 months...")
✅ Shows vulnerability ("first real product launch")
✅ Asks for genuine feedback, not just promotion
✅ Uses casual language ("pretty cool", "honestly", "you know")
✅ Mentions challenges ("that part took forever")
✅ Shows surprise ("I didn't expect...")
✅ Admits uncertainty ("I think", "I'm still iterating")
✅ Personal tone, not corporate
✅ Asks for roasts/negative feedback too

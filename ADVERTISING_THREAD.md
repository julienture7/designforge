Hey everyone! I just launched DesignForge, an AI website generator that I've been working on for months. I wanted to share what makes it unique because it's not just another "AI makes websites" tool.

**The Design Philosophy:**
Instead of generic templates, the AI is trained on a specific aesthetic combining:
- Brutalism (bold, high contrast)
- Swiss Design (precision typography)
- High-Fashion Editorial (luxury whitespace)

The goal? Generate designs that could actually win Awwwards Site of the Day.

**Key Features:**

1. **Anti-Boredom Directive** - Explicitly bans generic design patterns (Bootstrap blue, rounded corners everywhere, lorem ipsum). Instead uses bold colors, fluid typography, and scroll animations.

2. **3 Quality Tiers** - Basic (fast), Medium (refined), High (premium AI). Choose based on your needs.

3. **Conversational Editing** - Generate, then refine through chat. "Make it darker", "Add pricing", etc.

4. **Context-Aware** - Understands different domains. Restaurant prompts get menus, SaaS gets pricing tables, portfolios get showcases.

5. **Production-Ready** - Complete HTML with Tailwind, animations, responsive design. No cleanup needed.

**Pricing:**
- FREE: 20 credits (one-time), Basic & Medium modes
